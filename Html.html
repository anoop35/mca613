   <h2>A Brief History of HTML
1993 - Present</h2>
The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993.
 Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. 
 The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01,
 which became an official standard in December 1999.
Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. 
XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. 
Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language),
 MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). 
 Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), 
 their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, 
 and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML).
 XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML,
 but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it,
 interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn more 
 about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.
Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years, 
the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version
 of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is not yet an official 
 standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices,
 and is the way of the future. Therefore, HTML5 is the primary language taught in this course.
    <h2>Examples of types of content that can be included on web pages</h2>
	The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to web pages using different versions of HTML. 
	In the early days of the Web, HTML (version 1.2) was very simple,
	but over time new versions were released that added more and more features.
	Still, if web designers wanted to add content or features that HTML didn't support, 
	they would have to do so with non-standard proprietary technologies such as Adobe Flash. 
	These technologies would require users to install browser plug-ins, and in some cases meant that
	certain users would be unable to access the content (for example,
	iPhones and iPads don't support Flash).

HTML5 has added support for many new features that will make it possible to do more with HTML, 
without relying on non-standard proprietary technologies.

	 <h2>9 Reasons Every Professional Should Know a Little HTML </h2>
	 You’ve heard over and over that everyone should learn to code. Alright already! But as a writer, marketer, finance guru, or nonprofit worker, why in the world should you get into coding?
Well, I’m here to tell you that even a little knowledge of HTML and CSS can make a big 
difference in your career. And learning tech isn’t just for the production assistants and 
print designers of the world—whether you’re a small business owner, a sales manager, 
an event coordinator, or even a magician, you can benefit from some HTML and CSS chops.
Sound too good to be true? It’s not, and I’ll give you nine examples to prove it
But, first, let’s review what exactly HTML and CSS are. The short and sweet version is: 
HTML and CSS are the foundations of the web. HTML—“HyperText Markup Language”—is the language used 
to tell your web browser what each part of a website is. So, using HTML, you can define headers,
 paragraphs, links, images, and more, so your browser knows how to structure the web page you’re looking at.
CSS—“Cascading Style Sheets”—is the language that gives those web pages their look and formatting.
 In other words, CSS is what you use to make sites look nice with fancy fonts, rich colors, gorgeous
 backgrounds, and even slick animations and 3D effects.
Easy, right? But you’re probably still wondering: How am I supposed to use these coding languages in
 my job? Well, here are just a few of the amazing things you can achieve with just a few lines of
 these easy-to-learn languages. Trust me—your boss or potential employer will be impressed, your 
 colleagues will be happy, and you may be well on your way to a more fulfilling and lucrative career.
Here are nine things you will be able to do with your HTML and CSS skills:
